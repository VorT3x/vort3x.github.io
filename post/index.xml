      <description>I was aware of Jekyll and Github Pages long time ago, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have Ruby environment to generate my blog, so I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with Ghost blog on DigitalOcean.
Few months ago when I was on vacation I started to learn Golang:
Let the vacation begin! #golang @golang pic.twitter.com/LqAXc3g5ot

And of course I found Hugo. But I was busy and had no time for my blog until now.</description>

      <title>Sails.js on Heroku</title>

      <description>How to deploy your Sails.js application to Heroku.
First of all What is Sails.js? Per sailsjs.org:
 Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture. It&amp;rsquo;s especially good for building chat, realtime dashboards, or multiplayer games; but you can use it for any web application project - top to bottom.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
I wanted to start blogging years ago and it&amp;rsquo;s time to start. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen Ghost for my blog, hosted it on DigitalOcean and bought template made by EckoThemes from ThemeForest.
Mostly I&amp;rsquo;ll write technical articles. Currently I feel real passion to Node.js and want to dig it further, that&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen Ghost for blogging, since it&amp;rsquo;s built on Node.js. I really like how simple it&amp;rsquo;s comparable to Wordpress and it uses Markdown syntax for posts, which is also pleasant to use.</description>
